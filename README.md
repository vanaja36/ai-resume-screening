# AI-Powered Resume Screening and Classification  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automate resume screening. It classifies resumes based on skills, domains, and experience, helping recruiters save time and identify suitable candidates efficiently.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Preprocessing of resumes (text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)  
- Vectorization using **TF-IDF / CountVectorizer**  
- Machine Learning models for classification  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights  
- Visualizations of skills and domain trends  
- Scalable solution for HR and recruitment automation  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Handling)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML Models)  
- **NLP (TF-IDF, Tokenization)**  


## 📊 Workflow  
1. Data collection & preprocessing  
2. Resume text cleaning and vectorization  
3. Model training & evaluation  
4. Insights & visualization  
5. Deployment-ready classification pipeline  

## 🎯 Use Cases  
- Automated HR Resume Screening  
- Job applicant classification  
- Skill and domain extraction  
- Time-saving recruitment tools  

## 📈 Future Enhancements  
- Integration with **Deep Learning models (BERT, RoBERTa)**  
- Deployment as a **web application**  
- Real-time resume parsing
